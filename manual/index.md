**RuboCop** is a Ruby static code analyzer (a.k.a. linter) and code
formatter. Out of the box it will enforce many of the guidelines
outlined in the community [Ruby Style
Guide](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/ruby-style-guide).

Apart from reporting problems in your code, RuboCop can also
automatically fix some of the problems for you.

See ["Basic Usage"](basic_usage.md) to get yourself familiar with RuboCop's
capabilities.

RuboCop is an extremely flexible tool and most aspects of its behavior
can be tweaked via various [configuration
options](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/blob/master/config/default.yml).
